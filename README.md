# trivia-project

Before you begin, this application requires a Django Secret Key and an API Key. I can provide these upon request so that the application can run as intended.

The 'main_folder' holds both the 'frontend' and the 'backend'. In order to install the requirements, cd into 'backend' and run installations from there, then cd into 'frontend' and run 'npm install'. The database that the backend uses is named 'trivia_db'.
